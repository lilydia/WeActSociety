			<h1>WHY WE CARE?</h1>
			<p>
			Water is unlimited, but clean water is not. Less than 1% of all water on Earth can be used by us. It’s a lengthy, expensive process of purifying the water that comes out of our taps. The human race is only increasing in size, so it’s important that we use what we have left of this limited resource carefully.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our mission is not only to raise awareness on water conservation, but also to get people engaged and involved with saving water on a daily basis. The amount of fresh water in aquifers and rivers decreases every year, and some countries are already struggling with insufficient water supply due to climate change. 
			</p>
			<p>
			By setting an example in our own community of efficient water use, we spread the message to the rest of the world of the importance of saving and protecting our world’s most precious resource. While we promote water conservation in our community, we also aim to help other communities where clean water is limited and people suffer from water issues.
